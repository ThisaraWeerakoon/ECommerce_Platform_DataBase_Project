<h1 align="center">E-Commerce Platform DataBase Project</h1>
<p align="center"><i>Single Vendor E-Commerce Platform </i></p>


## Overview
<p>As part of <b>CS3043 - Database Systems</b> the database design project for a local retailer chain in Texas, this project involves creating a comprehensive database to support an e-commerce platform. By completing this project, able to implement:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Model the database to hold details about different products, including variants, categories, and custom attributes.</li>
        <li>Manage inventory, ensuring accurate count and consistency for each product variant.</li>
        <li>Support customer interactions, including registration, browsing, adding products to cart, and checkout processes.</li>
        <li>Implement order processing, capturing customer details, delivery methods, payment options, and reflecting changes in inventory.</li>
        <li>Develop a reporting system to generate quarterly sales reports, identify products with the most sales, analyze popular product categories, and monitor customer orders.</li>
        <li>Design a delivery module that calculates estimated delivery times based on product availability and delivery location.</li>
        <li>Employ procedures, functions, and triggers to guarantee ACID properties and maintain database consistency through primary keys, foreign keys, and indexing where necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This database design will ensure efficient management of the e-commerce platform, allowing the retailer to compete effectively with major players like Amazon.</p>

## Components

<ul>
    <li><strong>4-bit Add/Subtract Unit</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>This unit should be capable of adding and subtracting numbers represented using 2’s complement.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>3-bit Adder</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>This unit is used to increment the Program Counter.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>3-bit Program Counter (PC)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The Program Counter needs to be reset to 0 when required. Build it using D Flip-Flops with a clear/reset input.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>k-way b-bit Multiplexers</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A k-way b-bit multiplexer can take in k inputs, each with b bits, rather than a single bit. The output is a group of b bits. There are log<sub>2</sub> k control bits, and these control bits are used to select one of the k groups of b bits rather than a single bit.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Register Bank</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains 8, 4-bit registers (named R0 to R7).</li>
            <li>Hardcode value of R0 to all 0s.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Program ROM</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>This stores our Assembly program.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Buses</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Used 3, 4, and 12-bit buses to connect components. This had greatly simplified our design rather than running so many wires around. We used labels such as D(3 downto 0), I(11 downto 0), M(3 downto 0), and R(3 downto 0).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Instruction Decoder</strong>
        <ul>
            <li> The Instruction Decoder circuit is activating necessary components based on the instructions the user wish to execute</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  
</ul>


The following table contains the list of functions the shell should support
alongside with a brief description of what they are supposed to do.
